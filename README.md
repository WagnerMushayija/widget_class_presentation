# Flutter IconButton Demo

The demo includes multiple icon buttons, such as hamburger menu, close (X), favorite, search, and settings, each with different colors, sizes, and tooltips.

The app uses a dark theme and displays the buttons in a row, making it visually appealing for presentations or learning purposes.
